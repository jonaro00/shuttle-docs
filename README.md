# Shuttle Docs

## Contributing

If you found an error in our docs, or you simply want to make them better, contributions are always appreciated!

Our docs are powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) ([docs](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart)). To run them for local development:

Install [their cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify). Full instructions [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/development). NOTE: This requires Node v19+

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

And from the root of the repository, run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```
