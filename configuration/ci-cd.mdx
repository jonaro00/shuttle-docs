Shuttle currently provides one GitHub Action for automating deployments.

## GitHub Deploy Action

<Frame type="glass">

This action can run the `cargo shuttle deploy` command for you, enabling continuous deployments on every push.

[How to use and options here](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/deploy-action#readme).

Bear in mind that it does not handle `cargo shuttle project restart`, which is needed when upgrading Shuttle version. It is recommended to handle project restarts yourself, and let this action automate deployments that use the same version.
